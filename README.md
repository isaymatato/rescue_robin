# Rescue Robin

[**Demo**](http://rawgit.com/isaymatato/rescue_robin/master/dist/spriteTest.html)

Sprite and animation test for a game I worked on.  All the animations are procedural.  Pressing space will make the bugs blow up with a particle effect.  Works best in Chrome.

This was made using Renderer2D, an early HTML5 game renderer I made.  The game engine is built to be responsive, try resizing the browser window to see what I mean.
